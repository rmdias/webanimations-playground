# Web Animations Playground ❤️
An open source gallery where you can find cool animations made with Web Animations API

### How to contribute

It's super simple, you basically just have to checkout to your contribution branch from `gh-pages`

```
git checkout -b add/<project-name>
```

Then create a new file at `_posts` and add a preview image at `assets/img/previews` following the pattern:

file name: `yyyy-mm-dd-<project-name>.md`
file sctruture:
```
---
title: 'Snoop, the dog'
post_date: '9th December 2017'
image: 'assets/img/previews/snoop.png'
codepen: 'https://codepen.io/rmdias/pen/rpNpwB'
creator_name: 'Rodolfo Dias'
github_user: 'rmdias'
---
```

> Note, the animation has to be hosted at codepen :)

And finally commit your changes using this commit message pattern:
```
add(showcase): <project-name>
```
